# Instances

Every instance is generated by running the data_generation file. Each instance has the same structure that is explained in the following. 
For every instance there are 10 CSV files generated, one json file and multiple node specific CSV files.

## CSV files
The CSV files include every main aspect of data needed for the model to run.

### Gen_capacity

*  node: Node number

* g: Number of technology
* investment_cost: Investment cost needed to build the technology
* fixedOM: Actual costs associated with operating the technology that do not vary in the short term
* varOM: Actual costs associated with operating the technology in relation to the technology's occupancy rate
* fuel_cost: Costs of fuel needed for the technology to run
* efficiency: Efficiency rate of the technology
* emissions: Emissions generated by running the technology
